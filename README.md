# Falk-Hoffman Algorithm

Implements the Falk-Hoffman Algorithm to solve concave minimization problems over complex solution spaces (confined by linear constraints). As described in http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/opre.34.6.919
The file fhtest.py implements the two demonstration cases discussed in the paper.
